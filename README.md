# Learning Networked Dynamical Systems via A Mean-Field Approach

This repository is the official implementation of Efficient Learning of Networked Dynamical Systems via Steady States: A Mean-Field Approach

The `scripts` folder contains the commands to generate the experimental results in the tables and figures of the main text. For example, to run the experiments corresponding to table 3 in the main text, one can run
```bash
cd scripts
./TableIII_Efficiency.sh
```   
The results will be stored in `results` folder.

We store numerical results and use [DataGraph](https://www.visualdatatools.com/DataGraph/) to generate plots.
