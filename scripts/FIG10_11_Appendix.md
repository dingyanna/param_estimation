Enter folder 'Appendix' and launch MATLAB.
Run eco.m to generate the data for FIG10.
Fun gene.m to generate the data for FIG11.

The results for ecology is saved as `brn1.csv` and `brn2.csv`, each containing 2 columns specifying the coordinates (D,E). 
Gene regulatory dynamics' results are saved as `gene_brn.csv` with three columns specifying `h` and the functions `phi` defined by two block-regular networks with degree sequence `[r1, r2, r3]` and `[r1, r2, r4]`.
